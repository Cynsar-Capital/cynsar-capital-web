      to fostering innovation and social impact, Cynsar Capital stands out as a
      tech investment firm with a unique approach. Rather than blindly focusing
      on financial returns, our emphasis is on supporting and nurturing ideas
      and projects that adhere to our core principles of equity, fairness, and
      transparency, and have the potential to make a real difference in society.
      This philosophy aligns with our goal to build open social capital products
      that bring about positive change.


      Our partnership with the Cynsar Foundation plays an integral part in our
      model. Serving as an 'idea incubator,' the foundation is responsible for
      rigorously vetting potential projects, ensuring their viability,
      innovative potential, and capacity for high social and environmental
      impact. This process is crucial in maintaining our dedication to
      developing technologies that prioritize people over processes and view
      technology as a tool for betterment.


      Once a project passes this rigorous evaluation process by the Cynsar
      Foundation, Cynsar Capital steps in, providing the necessary financial
      investment to transform the idea into a thriving, impactful business. This
      symbiotic relationship creates a pipeline of thoroughly tested,
      high-potential projects for investment, significantly reducing associated
      risks.


      We are proud to currently support two projects incubated at the local
      level by the Cynsar Foundation. The Bishnu Project, an FMCG enterprise
      specializing in the online sale of organic goods, taps into a rapidly
      growing market segment with enormous potential for both profits and
      positive environmental impact. The second,
      [500women.art](https://500women.art), is a collective of 500 women
      dedicated to promoting fair and ethical textile production, intertwining
      social impact with a sustainable business model.


      Historically, we have funded these projects using personal funds. However,
      as we move forward, we plan to introduce a corporate structure that
      enables us to channel funds from Cynsar Capital to these ventures,
      incorporating them as subsidiaries of Cynsar Capital.


      Our business model is centered around experimentation and validation. We
      first test ideas in a non-profit environment to discover clear,
      sustainable paths to profitability. This unique approach ensures that by
      the time Cynsar Capital invests in a project, it has already been
      thoroughly vetted for feasibility and potential profitability, effectively
      minimizing risk and maximizing chances of success. It is through this
      model that we strive to make a meaningful difference, contributing to a
      more equitable, fair, and transparent human ecosystem.


      Currently, Cynsar Capital has two projects that have been incubated at the
      local level by the Cynsar Foundation:


      1.  The first is the Bishnu Project, an FMCG enterprise focused on selling
      organic goods online. This is a rapidly growing market segment with
      significant potential for profits and positive environmental impact.


      2.  The second is 500women.art, a collective of 500 women who are working
      to promote fair and ethical textile production. This project combines
      social impact with a sustainable business model, creating opportunities
      for women and promoting responsible manufacturing practices.
