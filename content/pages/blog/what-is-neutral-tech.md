What is neutral tech? Some thoughts on technology neutrality.
Technology ideally leads to a neutral change, but if it does not happen, then technology is not neutral. Consequently, we can assume the creators of technology are also not neutral. To better understand what neutral technology could be, we can consider these axioms:

1.  Equitable

2.  Fair

3.  Transparent

In our case, the technology that brings or promotes change should be equitable, fair, and transparent. For instance, consider the case of social media platforms producing misinformation and creating unfair or biased societal conditions. Defining technology is challenging, but generally, it can be anything that provides an application or an output. The way we use technology subjects it to morality, and it is not restricted to the human domain only.

One example is the Internal Combustion Engine that utilizes fossil fuels, which are incompatible with decarbonization. Such engines are in practice today, despite their adverse environmental impacts. The concept of "good" technology is subjective and relies on quantitative methods that sometimes lack results.

Technology, as a tool, has pre and post-actions subject to moral standpoints. Most technology depends on the user and how they use it. Tech creators have a role in moral responsibility, but there are loopholes in this argument. The creator might be hiding behind the creation, and users can derive use cases the creator had not anticipated.

As Mark Twain stated, "if you have the hammer on your end, everything else looks like a nail." Our freedom is severely limited by the technological environment. For example, someone applying for a visa from India through technical identification is subject to human bias encoded in technology. No one anticipated the dangers these marvelous inventions could bring, such as annual deaths resulting from the Internal Combustion Engine that powers automobiles.

We cannot be sure of the consequences of our innovations. Hence, creators may not even know what biases they encode in the technology they develop. Complexity arises when competition emerges, where banning a particular technology is difficult if that technology is available in different geographies, similar to how we tackle climate mitigation.

To create a more responsible and sustainable technological landscape, incorporating the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into the oversight framework can be a crucial step. By aligning technological advancements with these global goals, we can harness their potential to drive sustainable development while acknowledging that technology will never be entirely neutral due to inherent human values and intentions.

Can tech be neutral? We will discuss this thoroughly in future research, share findings, and invite ideas from various stakeholders. The integration of ethical guidelines, transparency, accountability, and diverse perspectives can help us strive for a technological landscape that is more responsible, ethical, and beneficial for all, while understanding that no technology will ever be completely neutral.
