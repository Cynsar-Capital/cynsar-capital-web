      We wanted to send you a formal thank you for supporting our business over
      the years. However, our lawyer advised against it since being overly
      sincere could open us up to lawsuits if we don't live up to your wild
      expectations.


      So instead, here is a haiku:


      You buy our products

      We take your hard earned money

      This is business, folks


      We considered writing the message in morse code to make it more creative,
      but realized most people can't decode morse code anymore. We briefly
      pondered writing it in Klingon as well, but our translator quit recently
      after we denied his request to take a mental health day "to escape this
      soul-crushing workplace."


      Anywho, we appreciate your business, unless you decided to take it
      elsewhere. In that case, we always found you difficult to deal with and
      don't know why we put up with your nonsense for so long. But for the rest
      of you still giving us money, thanks! Now get back to shopping and pumping
      up those sales numbers for Q3.


      Sincerely,

      The Management
