      Welcome to our website! We're thrilled you've decided to visit us instead
      of doing something more productive.


      Here at Cynsar Capital , we don't collect any personal information because
      we don't actually know how. We're an aloof, high-minded organization
      focused on changing the world through artisanal bookmarks or whatever it
      is we do.


      We built this entire website using Stackbit because one of our developers
      saw an ad for it and impulsively clicked "Try it Free!" Now we're in too
      deep to turn back. Oh, Stackbit, what have you done?


      GitHub hosts our code because we heard it was hip with the youths. We
      don't know what GitHub does but supposedly it has something to do with
      tech? We're artists, man.


      Now, if you're an investor, partner, or someone important, we may have
      dropped your name somewhere on this site. Sorry about that - we know
      name-dropping is tacky but we're starving for credibility here. Let's just
      edit that out later if it bothers you.


      What else? Oh right, privacy stuff. Look, we don't sell your data because
      we don't have any to begin with. We use cookies to store information we'll
      never look at again. There are probably analytics tracking you but we
      wouldn't know how to access them. Honestly, you should be more concerned
      about us accidentally leaking everything than maliciously misusing
      anything.


      And that's it! Thanks for reading this ironclad legal doc that is
      definitely not satire. We wish we could assure you we know what we're
      doing, but that would be dishonest. Enjoy exploring the site! Let us know
      if you find any cool bugs.
