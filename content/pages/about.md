    title: About our business
    text: "Cynsar Capital was founded in 2021 by Saransh, an entrepreneur with experience in building financial tools,\_ and Cici, a retired corporate finance attorney. Saransh, with his expertise in developing research-oriented businesses, handles the key operations. Cici, with her experience as a financial lawyer, serves as an advisor and initial investor.\n\nCynsar Capital has dedicated considerable time and resources to conduct extensive internal research in collaboration with our partners. This investment has allowed us to gain a deep understanding of market size and emerging opportunities. Based on our findings, we have identified specific areas of management in which we aspire to take the lead and offer innovative solutions.\n\nAt Cynsar Capital, we prioritize building strong connections with like-minded individuals and businesses. These connections extend beyond mere professional relationships, often evolving into friendships and a sense of family.
